## Background
The focus of the Yolo Bypass Mass Balance study was to investigates mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) loads entering and exiting the Yolo Bypass when it is actively flooding. This work is for compliance with the Delta Mercury Control Program (DMCP) promulgated by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB). DWR staff collected water samples for the study during the winters of 2014, 2016, and 2017. A majority of the samples were collected during the extended 4-month flood event in the Yolo Bypass during the winter of 2017.
