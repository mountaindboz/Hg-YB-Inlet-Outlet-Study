# Open Water Mercury Studies
This repository contains the R files used for data analysis and final report figures and tables for the Open Water Mercury studies conducted by staff at the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). This work is for compliance with the Delta Mercury Control Program (DMCP) promulgated by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB). The Open Water studies are divided into two categories: 
1. The Yolo Bypass Mass Balance study
2. Vegetation Senescence studies

This repository contains folders reflecting this categorical organization. All data files used in the R files in this repository are stored on a DWR SharePoint site for the Open Water Final Report. Final report figures and tables are stored on the same SharePoint site.

## Yolo Bypass Mass Balance study
This study investigates mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) loads entering and exiting the Yolo Bypass when it is actively flooding. The folder for this study is organized into multiple sub-folders (Concentrations, Flows, Loads, Field Measurements) based upon the type of data processed and analyzed. 

## Vegetation Senescence studies
These are a group of three studies investigating the effect of flooded vegetation on the MeHg concentrations in the overlying water. Two of these studies used a mesocosm design to simulate flooded pasture land in the Yolo Bypass under various types of land use practices (ungrazed, grazed, and disked). The third study was a lab study comparing treatments with varying amounts of vegetation, sediment, and manure.
