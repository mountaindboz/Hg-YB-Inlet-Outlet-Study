# Purpose of Analysis

For this analysis, I am focusing on the nine sampling events when the Fremont Weir was spilling. Of these nine events, I want to find which events had fairly consistent water masses moving from the Fremont Weir downstream through the Toe Drain on the east side of the Bypass. I will determine consistency by looking at various source ID parameters including specific conductance, ICP cations, ICP-MS metals, and boron. I will then look for trends in the following concentration-based parameters at the Fremont and Sacramento Weirs and the Toe Drain transect sampling locations for only the sampling events deemed to have relatively consistent water masses from upstream to downstream: 

  * Methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (THg) concentrations in both the filtered and particulate fractions
  * The percent of each fraction for MeHg and THg
  * Total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations
  * MeHg and THg concentrations on solids which provide estimates of the amount of mercury bound to the suspended sediment. An increasing or decreasing trend in these parameters indicate either an enrichment or reduction of mercury on suspended particles.
  * MeHg and THg partitioning coefficients (Kd). An increasing trend in these parameters indicates greater partitioning of mercury to the solid-bound phase, and a decreasing trend indicates greater partitioning to the filtered or dissolved phase.
  * The percent of THg that is MeHg. An increasing trend indicates more of the total mercury is methylmercury.

# Import and Prepare Data

Load R packages necessary for this analysis:
```{r load packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(knitr)
library(openwaterhg)
```

Bring in, clean, and combine all data:
```{r import and clean data, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Import concentration data
source("YB_Mass_Balance/Concentrations/Import_Conc_Data.R")

# Clean comb_param_calc to bind to all_conc
comb_param_clean <- comb_param_calc %>% 
  rename(
    Analyte = Parameter,
    Conc = Value
  ) %>% 
  mutate(Detect = "Detect")

# Clean Specific Conductance field data to bind to all_conc
spcond_clean <- field_data %>% 
  select(
    StationName, 
    SampleDate, 
    Conc = SpCond
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    Analyte = "Specific Conductance",
    Units = "uS/cm",
    Detect = "Detect"
  )

# Bind all data
all_conc1 <- bind_rows(all_conc, comb_param_clean, spcond_clean)

# Clean all concentration data
all_conc_clean <- all_conc1 %>% 
  select(
    StationName,
    SampleDate,
    Analyte,
    Conc,
    Detect,
    Units
  )

# Clean up
rm(all_conc, all_conc1, comb_param_clean, spcond_clean)
```

Prepare Hg data for fraction plots:  
```{r prepare Hg data for fraction plots}
conc_hg <- all_conc_clean %>% 
  filter(
    Analyte %in% c(
      "MeHg- filtered",
      "MeHg- particulate",
      "THg- filtered",
      "THg- particulate"
    )
  ) %>% 
  separate(Analyte, into = c("Hg_analyte", "Fraction"), sep = "- ") %>% 
  mutate(Fraction = str_to_title(Fraction))
```

```{r calculate percentages of Hg fractions, echo = FALSE}
conc_per_hg <- conc_hg %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = StationName:Hg_analyte,
    names_from = Fraction,
    values_from = Conc
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    Filt_per = round(Filtered/(Filtered + Particulate) * 100, 1),
    Part_per = round(Particulate/(Filtered + Particulate) * 100, 1)
  )
```

# Results

Create plots of each event:
```{r create plots}
major_flood_east_plots <- major_flood_east %>%
  mutate(df = map(df, ~group_nest(.x, SamplingEvent))) %>% 
  unnest(df) %>% 
  mutate(
    plots = case_when(
      name == "sourceID" ~ map2(data, SamplingEvent, .f = plots_source_id),
      name == "parameters" ~ map2(data, SamplingEvent, .f = plots_param_all),
      name == "hg_stack" ~ map2(data, SamplingEvent, .f = plots_hg_frac),
      name == "hg_fill" ~ map2(data, SamplingEvent, .f = plots_hg_per_frac)
    )
  )
```


## Source ID

### Plots

```{r source id plots 1, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 9}
source_id_plots <- major_flood_east_plots %>% 
  filter(name == "sourceID")

source_id_plots %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(SamplingEvent, "^Apr")) %>% 
  pull(plots) %>% 
  walk(print)
```

```{r source id plots 2}
source_id_plots %>% 
  filter(SamplingEvent == "Apr 11-12, 2017") %>% 
  pull(plots) %>% 
  chuck(1)
```

```{r source id plots 3, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 9}
source_id_plots %>% 
  filter(SamplingEvent == "Apr 25-26, 2017") %>% 
  pull(plots) %>% 
  chuck(1)
```

### Specific Conductance Ratios

We can also look at the ratios of specific conductance between Fremont Weir (average of 3 stations) and each Toe Drain transect location. When the Sacramento Weir was open, I included it in the Fremont Weir average for the stations downstream of Road 22. Ratios close to one indicate a stable water source with little to no mixing from other inputs.

```{r spcond ratios, message = FALSE}
# Filter Specific Conductance
major_flood_east_spcond <- major_flood_east %>% 
  filter(name == "sourceID") %>% 
  pull(df) %>% 
  chuck(1) %>% 
  filter(Analyte == "Specific Conductance")

# Calculate averages of Fremont Weir stations for each sampling event
fre_spcond <- major_flood_east_spcond %>% 
  filter(str_detect(ShortName, "^Fre")) %>% 
  group_by(SamplingEvent) %>% 
  summarize(FW_Avg = mean(Conc))

# Add Sacramento Weir values and averages to the df
fre_sac_spcond <- major_flood_east_spcond %>% 
  filter(str_detect(ShortName, "^SR")) %>% 
  left_join(fre_spcond) %>% 
  select(SamplingEvent, Conc, FW_Avg) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Conc:FW_Avg,
    names_to = "spcond",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(SamplingEvent) %>% 
  summarize(FW_SW_Avg = mean(value)) %>%
  right_join(fre_spcond)

# Calculate ratios
ratio_spcond <- major_flood_east_spcond %>%
  filter(str_detect(ShortName, "^Toe|^Prospect")) %>% 
  left_join(fre_sac_spcond) %>% 
  mutate(
    Ratio = case_when(
      str_detect(ShortName, "Rd 22") ~ Conc/FW_Avg,
      !str_detect(ShortName, "Rd 22") & !is.na(FW_SW_Avg) ~ Conc/FW_SW_Avg,
      TRUE ~ Conc/FW_Avg
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(Ratio = round(Ratio, 2)) %>% 
  arrange(SamplingEvent, ShortName) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = SamplingEvent,
    names_from = ShortName,
    values_from = Ratio
  )

rm(major_flood_east_spcond, fre_spcond, fre_sac_spcond)

# Print ratios in a kable
kable(ratio_spcond, caption = "Specific Conductance Ratios- Toe Drain site:Fremont Weir")
```

### Conclusions

The following sampling events had a relatively stable water source from the upstream to the downstream stations along the Toe Drain:

  * March 15-16, 2016: all stations were somewhat consistent except for the I-80 site which was much different and could have had more CCSB water mixed in
  * January 24-25, 2017: overall the source ID parameters and ratios were fairly consistent, but water from the Sacramento Weir had a visible influence downstream of the Rd 22 station
  * January 31 - February 1, 2017: all stations except for the Rd 22 site
  * February 14-15, 2017: all Toe Drain stations were relatively consistent, but had lower specific conductance values than Fremont Weir
  * March 1-2, 2017: all stations except for the Rd 22 site
  * April 25-26, 2017: all stations except for the Rd 22 and I-80 sites

Plots showing the filtered and particulate MeHg concentrations, MeHg and THg concentrations on solids, and partitioning coefficients (Kd) for each of these six sampling events are below.

## Parameter Plots for each Sampling Event

```{r parameter and Hg plots for each event}
param_hg_plots <- major_flood_east_plots %>% 
  filter(name != "sourceID")
```

```{r filter and print parameter plot function}
filt_print_param_plots <- function(df, filt_var, filt_cond) {
  filt_var_enquo <- enquo(filt_var)
  
  df %>% 
    filter(!!filt_var_enquo == filt_cond) %>% 
    pull(plots) %>% 
    walk(print)
}
```

### March 15-16, 2016

```{r parameter plots Mar 15-16 2016 event, fig.width = 8}
filt_print_param_plots(param_hg_plots, SamplingEvent, "Mar 15-16, 2016")
```

**Observations:**

  * The Toe Drain at I-80 site was an anomaly which was consistent with its source ID parameters indicating water from a different source. The source ID parameters for this site aren't completely similar to any other inlet to the Bypass during this event.
  * For the other stations along the Toe Drain transect, the total MeHg concentrations, THg concentrations on solids, and the THg partitioning coefficients all steadily increased from upstream to downstream. 
  * The MeHg concentrations on solids increased from the Fremont Weir to the Toe Drain at 1/2 Lisbon station. Also, the MeHg Kd's sharply increased between Rd 22 and Lisbon.
  * The Fremont Weir sites had higher total THg and TSS concentrations that the Toe Drain transect stations with the exception of Prospect Slough which had a similar total THg concentration to those at Fremont Weir. Total THg and TSS concentrations increased from east to west along the Fremont Weir.

***

### January 24-25, 2017

```{r parameter plots Jan 24-25 2017 event, fig.width = 8}
filt_print_param_plots(param_hg_plots, SamplingEvent, "Jan 24-25, 2017")
```

**Observations:**

  * Generally, total MeHg and THg concentrations, MeHg concentrations on solids, and MeHg Kd's increased as water moved downstream from Rd 22 to 1/2 Lisbon.
  * For the THg concentrations on solids and THg Kd's, the values for Rd 22 are close to the averages of the Fremont Weir sites and the values for the other Toe Drain stations downstream are closer to the Sacramento Weir values. This is consistent with what the source ID parameters suggested.
  * The percent MeHg of the THg values were relatively stable along the Toe Drain transect and were higher than the values for the inlet stations.
  * Total THg concentrations were generally higher at the Fremont and Sacramento Weir sites than the Toe Drain sites. In addition, the Fremont Weir sites had the highest TSS concentrations. Total THg and TSS concentrations increased from east to west along the Fremont Weir.
  * The Prospect Slough station, which is the furthest downstream transect location, had consistently lower values of most parameters when compared to its adjacent upstream location, 1/2 Lisbon.

***

### January 31 - February 1, 2017

```{r parameter plots Jan 31 - Feb 1 2017 event, fig.width = 8}
filt_print_param_plots(param_hg_plots, SamplingEvent, "Jan 31-Feb 1, 2017")
```

**Observations:**

  * Excluding the Rd 22 site which was anomalous according to the source ID parameters, the total MeHg concentrations, MeHg and THg concentrations on solids, MeHg Kd's, and percent MeHg of THg were all noticeably higher in the Toe Drain transect locations when compared to the Fremont Weir stations. The reverse was true for the TSS concentrations with the Fremont Weir sites having higher values than the Toe Drain sites.
  * The MeHg concentrations on solids were relatively stable along the Toe Drain transect, which was also true for the MeHg Kd values with the exception of I-80 which had a lower MeHg Kd due to a relatively higher filtered MeHg concentration.
  * Total MeHg concentrations gradually decreased from upstream to downstream along the transect.
  * The THg concentrations on solids and THg Kd's steadily decreased from upstream to downstream along the transect.
  * Total THg concentrations were relatively similar at all stations except for Rd 22 which had a significantly higher value.
  * Total THg, total MeHg and TSS concentrations were fairly consistent across the Fremont Weir sites.

***

### February 14-15, 2017

```{r parameter plots Feb 14-15 2017 event, fig.width = 8}
filt_print_param_plots(param_hg_plots, SamplingEvent, "Feb 14-15, 2017")
```

**Observations:**

  * Excluding Prospect Slough, MeHg and THg concentrations on solids and Kd's increased from upstream to downstream along the Toe Drain transect. Values of all of these parameters dropped at Prospect Slough.
  * Total MeHg concentrations remained fairly consistent across the transect with slightly lower values at the Lisbon station. Total THg concentrations were fairly consistent across the transect as well.
  * With the exception of Fremont Weir- Middle, the total MeHg concentrations of the transect locations were similar to the inlet concentrations.
  * Total THg and TSS concentrations at the Fremont Weir sites followed the same trend with the middle and western sites having similar and higher values than the eastern site. Total THg and TSS were highest at the Fremont Weir middle and west sites and at Sacramento Weir.
  * TSS concentrations gradually decreased from upstream to downstream along the Toe Drain transect.

***

### March 1-2, 2017

```{r parameter plots Mar 1-2 2017 event, fig.width = 8}
filt_print_param_plots(param_hg_plots, SamplingEvent, "Mar 1-2, 2017")
```

**Observations:**

  * Total MeHg concentrations were relatively consistent across the Toe Drain transect which were slightly higher than values at Fremont Weir and lower than values at the Sacramento Weir.
  * The percentages of the filtered MeHg fraction were higher at all of the transect locations (except for Rd 22 which was an anomaly according the to the source ID parameters) than the filtered MeHg percentages at the inlet locations.
  * The MeHg concentrations on solids and Kd's increased sharply at Prospect Slough.
  * Excluding the Rd 22 site which was an anomaly according to the source ID parameters, the MeHg concentrations on solids decreased along the Toe Drain transect from I-80 to 1/2 Lisbon. There was no clear trend in MeHg Kd's along the transect.
  * The percent MeHg of THg values were higher at the Toe Drain sites than the inlet values.
  * THg concentrations on solids remained fairly consistent across the transect from I-80 to Prospect Slough. THg Kd's followed the same trend except for the value at Prospect Slough decreased sharply.
  * Sacramento Weir had the highest total MeHg, total THg, and TSS concentrations as well as the highest THg concentration on solids.
  * The inlet sites had higher TSS concentrations than the Toe Drain transect stations.
  * Total THg and TSS concentrations were fairly similar at all of the Fremont Weir sites.

***

### April 25-26, 2017

```{r parameter plots Apr 25-26 2017 event, fig.width = 8}
filt_print_param_plots(param_hg_plots, SamplingEvent, "Apr 25-26, 2017")
```

**Observations:**

  * Excluding the Rd 22 and I-80 sites which were anomalies according to the source ID parameters, the total MeHg concentrations, MeHg concentrations on solids, MeHg Kd's, and percent MeHg of THg were all noticeably higher in the Toe Drain transect locations when compared to the Fremont Weir stations. The reverse was true for the TSS concentrations with the Fremont Weir sites having higher values than the Toe Drain sites.
  * The MeHg concentrations on solids and Kd's were relatively stable along the Toe Drain transect.
  * There was no clear trend for the THg concentrations on solids and Kd's.
  * Toe Drain at I-80 had a much higher percentage of it's THg in the filtered fraction at 80%. This was reflected in it's THg Kd value which was much lower than all other sites. Interestingly, the I-80 site also had the highest MeHg concentration on solids and percent MeHg of THg, and the lowest THg concentration on solids and TSS concentration.

## Each parameter across all Sampling Events

Overall, each sampling event seemed to have unique trends in the MeHg, THg, and TSS parameters along the eastern transect. To look at more unifying themes, we can visualize this data in another way. We can look at the same parameter across all six sampling events after removing the anomalous station-sampling event combinations according to the source ID parameters.

Remove anomalous station-sampling event combinations:
```{r remove anomalous station-sampling event combos}
major_flood_east_no_anom <- major_flood_east %>% 
  slice(2:3) %>% 
  mutate(
    df = map(
      df,
      # Filter each nested tibble
      ~filter(
        .x, 
        !SamplingEvent %in% c(
          "Jan 11-12, 2017", 
          "Mar 28-29, 2017", 
          "Apr 11-12, 2017"
        ),
        !(ShortName == "Toe Dr at I-80" & 
          SamplingEvent %in% c(
            "Mar 15-16, 2016", 
            "Apr 25-26, 2017"
          )
        ),
        !(ShortName == "Toe Dr at Rd 22" & 
          SamplingEvent %in% c(
            "Jan 31-Feb 1, 2017", 
            "Mar 1-2, 2017", 
            "Apr 25-26, 2017"
          )
        )
      ) %>% 
      # Drop missing factors in each nested tibble
      mutate(SamplingEvent = fct_drop(SamplingEvent))
    )
  )
```

Create plots for each parameter:
```{r create parameter plots same}
param_plots_same <- major_flood_east_no_anom %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(df) %>% 
  chuck(1) %>% 
  group_nest(Analyte, Units) %>% 
  mutate(plots = pmap(list(data, Analyte, Units), .f = plots_param_same))
```

### MeHg Concentration on Solids

```{r plots MeHg conc on solids}
filt_print_param_plots(param_plots_same, Analyte, "MeHg Concentration on Solids")
```

  * There was no consistent trend along the Toe Drain transect across all sampling events. Concentrations increased from upstream to downstream along the transect for three of the sampling events. Concentrations decreased for one event, and the other two had relatively stable concentrations.
  * For four of the six sampling events, Prospect Slough seemed to be an outlier indicating that it may have water from a different source when compared to the other Toe Drain sites; however, the source ID parameters didn't suggest this. Prospect Slough is the most downstream station along the transect and is located below the confluence of the Toe Drain and Liberty Cut.
  * Concentrations were generally higher in the Toe Drain transect sites compared to the input sites, indicating possible enrichment of MeHg on suspended sediments once water entered the Toe Drain.

### MeHg Partitioning Coefficient

```{r plots MeHg Kd}
filt_print_param_plots(param_plots_same, Analyte, "MeHg Partitioning Coefficient (Kd)")
```

**Observations:**

  * Again, there was no consistent trend along the Toe Drain transect across all sampling events.
  * For the same four sampling events as with the MeHg concentrations on solids, Prospect Slough seemed to be an outlier.
  * The Toe Drain stations that were further downstream had higher MeHg Kd values than the inlet sites during four sampling events.
  * The January 31 - Feb 1, 2017 and April 25-26, 2017 sampling events had almost identical trends in their MeHg concentrations on solids and Kd values.

### MeHg Concentrations

```{r plots MeHg conc, fig.width = 8}
mehg_plots <- major_flood_east_no_anom %>% 
  slice(2) %>% 
  pull(df) %>% 
  chuck(1) %>% 
  filter(Hg_analyte == "MeHg") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ShortName, y = Conc, fill = Fraction)) +
    facet_wrap(vars(SamplingEvent)) +
    add_gen_color_pal(
      num_colors = 2,
      aes_type = "fill",
      legend_title = "Fraction"
    ) +
    theme_owhg(x_axis_v = TRUE) +
    theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 0.5, b = 0.5, unit = "cm"))

mehg_plots + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(
    title = "MeHg Concentrations",
    x = "Station",
    y = "Concentration (ng/L)"
  )
```

**Observations:**

  * For five of the six sampling events, total MeHg concentrations were higher at the Toe Drain transect stations than at the Fremont Weir sites. The differences were very small, however, during one of these events.
  * Total MeHg concentrations were relatively consistent at all sites during the other sampling event on February 14-15, 2017. This was the largest event in terms of inflow, and it is possible that the water moved so quickly through the Toe Drain that it didn't accumulate any additional MeHg.
  * Total MeHg concentrations were relatively consistent along the Toe Drain transect itself with the exception of the March 15-16, 2016 event during which concentrations increased from upstream to downstream in the Toe Drain.

### MeHg Percent of each Fraction

```{r plots MeHg per frac, fig.width = 8}
mehg_plots +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    title = "MeHg Percent of each Fraction",
    x = "Station",
    y = "Fraction Percentage"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format())
```

**Observations:**

  * The percent of each MeHg fraction varied between sites and sampling events, but there was no obvious trend or pattern.

***

### Percent MeHg of THg

```{r plots percent MeHg of THg}
filt_print_param_plots(param_plots_same, Analyte, "Percent tMeHg Conc of the tTHg Conc")
```

**Observations:**

  * For all but one sampling event, the Toe Drain sites had higher percent MeHg of THg values than the inlet sites.
  * There was no consistent trend along the Toe Drain transect itself.

***

### THg Concentration on Solids

```{r plots THg conc on solids}
filt_print_param_plots(param_plots_same, Analyte, "THg Concentration on Solids")
```

**Observations:**

  * Trends in the THg concentrations on solids were unique for each sampling event. 

***

### THg Partitioning Coefficient

```{r plots THg Kd}
filt_print_param_plots(param_plots_same, Analyte, "THg Partitioning Coefficient (Kd)")
```

**Observations:**

  * As with the concentrations on solids, the trends in the THg partitioning coefficients were unique for each sampling event.

***

### THg Concentrations

```{r plots THg conc, fig.width = 8}
thg_plots <- major_flood_east_no_anom %>% 
  slice(2) %>% 
  pull(df) %>% 
  chuck(1) %>% 
  filter(Hg_analyte == "THg") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ShortName, y = Conc, fill = Fraction)) +
    facet_wrap(vars(SamplingEvent)) +
    add_gen_color_pal(
      num_colors = 2,
      aes_type = "fill",
      legend_title = "Fraction"
    ) +
    theme_owhg(x_axis_v = TRUE) +
    theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 0.5, b = 0.5, unit = "cm"))

thg_plots + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(
    title = "THg Concentrations",
    x = "Station",
    y = "Concentration (ng/L)"
  )
```

**Observations:**

  * There was a gradient of lower to higher total THg concentrations from the eastern side of Fremont Weir to the western side during the March 15-16, 2016 and January 24-25, 2017 events. In addition, concentrations were lower at the eastern side of Fremont Weir than the other two Weir locations during two additional events.
  * For four of the six events, there was little to no difference between the total THg concentrations between the inlets and the Toe Drain sites with the exception of Sacramento Weir on March 1, 2017 which seems anomalously high. For the two remaining events, the inlets had higher total THg concentrations than the Toe Drain sites.
  * For the most part, the total THg concentrations were relatively consistent along the Toe Drain transect itself across all sampling events.

The differences in total THg concentrations between the Fremont Weir sites during some of the sampling events were interesting. Here is a plot showing total THg concentrations for the Fremont Weir stations for all sampling events when the Weir was spilling:

```{r plots THg conc Fremont Weir}
major_flood_east %>% 
  slice(3) %>% 
  pull(df) %>% 
  chuck(1) %>% 
  filter(
    Hg_analyte == "THg",
    str_detect(ShortName, "^Fre")
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ShortName, y = Conc, fill = Fraction)) +
    geom_col() +
    facet_wrap(
      vars(SamplingEvent),
      scales = "free_y"
    ) +
    labs(
      title = "Fremont Weir THg Concentrations",
      x = "Station",
      y = "Concentration (ng/L)"
    ) +
    add_gen_color_pal(
      num_colors = 2,
      aes_type = "fill",
      legend_title = "Fraction"
    ) +
    theme_owhg(x_axis_v = TRUE) +
    theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 0.5, b = 0.5, unit = "cm"))
```

There doesn't appear to be a consistent theme in total THg concentrations among the Fremont Weir sites across all sampling events; however, concentrations were lowest on the eastern side during five of nine events.

***

### THg Percent of each Fraction

```{r plots THg per frac, fig.width = 8}
thg_plots +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    title = "THg Percent of each Fraction",
    x = "Station",
    y = "Fraction Percentage"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format())
```

**Observations:**

  * The percentages of each THg fraction were relatively similar across all stations and sampling events with the filtered fraction ranging between 15-25% of the total.
  * There were no obvious trends between the inlets and the Toe Drain sites or the Toe Drain transect itself.

***

### Total Suspended Solids

```{r plots TSS}
filt_print_param_plots(param_plots_same, Analyte, "TSS")
```

**Observations:**

  * TSS concentrations were generally lower at the Toe Drain transect stations than at the Fremont and Sacramento Weirs.
  * Concentrations were fairly consistent along the transect itself during most sampling events.
  * There was a gradient of lower to higher TSS concentrations from the eastern side of Fremont Weir to the western side during the March 15-16, 2016 and January 24-25, 2017 events. In addition, concentrations were lower at the eastern side of Fremont Weir than the other two Weir locations during three additional events. These trends are similar to the THg concentrations. Here is a plot showing TSS concentrations for the Fremont Weir stations for all sampling events when the Weir was spilling:
  
```{r plots TSS Fremont Weir}
major_flood_east %>% 
  slice(2) %>% 
  pull(df) %>% 
  chuck(1) %>% 
  filter(
    Analyte == "TSS",
    str_detect(ShortName, "^Fre")
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ShortName, y = Conc)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = 1)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(
      vars(SamplingEvent),
      scales = "free_y"
    ) +
    labs(
      title = "Fremont Weir TSS Concentrations",
      x = "Station",
      y = "Concentration (mg/L)"
    ) +
    add_gen_color_pal(
      num_colors = 2,
      aes_type = "fill",
      legend_title = "Fraction"
    ) +
    theme_owhg(x_axis_v = TRUE) +
    theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 0.5, b = 0.5, unit = "cm"))
```

There doesn't appear to be a consistent theme in TSS concentrations among the Fremont Weir sites across all sampling events; however, concentrations were lowest on the eastern side during six of nine events.

# Overall Observations

MeHg concentrations on solids were generally higher in the Toe Drain transect sites compared to the input sites. This was mostly reflected in the MeHg partitioning coefficients as well. The Toe Drain stations that were further downstream had higher MeHg Kd values than the inlet sites during four sampling events. In addition, total MeHg concentrations were higher at the Toe Drain sites than at the Fremont Weir sites for five of the six sampling events. Interestingly, TSS concentrations were generally lower at the Toe Drain transect stations than at the Fremont and Sacramento Weirs. This suggests that while suspended sediment concentrations decreased in the Toe Drain, the suspended sediment that remained was more enriched with MeHg.

For all but one sampling event, the Toe Drain sites had higher percent MeHg of THg values than the inlet sites.

There were no obvious or consistent trends in any THg, MeHg, or TSS parameter along the Toe Drain transect itself across all sampling events.

There was a gradient of lower to higher total THg concentrations from the eastern side of Fremont Weir to the western side during the four of the nine sampling events when the Weir was spilling. TSS followed this same trend for three of these events. Overall, total THg and TSS concentrations were lower at the eastern side of Fremont Weir than the other two Weir locations during five and six events, respectively. This may be due to water mixing in from the Feather River on the eastern side.
